## Project management:

We can use Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM) convenience (not necessary):

- Use GitHub Projects to create issues and track tasks
- Add issue-xxx (xxx - number of the issue provided by GitHub ex. issue-001) to the name
- Create branch issue-xxx from main branch to work on it
- Do not commit to main branch directly, only merge with Pull Request.
